# Portfolio
This portfolio contains artifacts that demonstrate critical computer science skills I've accumulated over the past four years at SNHU.
### Professional Self-Assessment
I analyze all of the concepts and skills I've picked up from my previous classes and how I incorporated them into my capstone projects. This assessment served not only as an opportunity to reflect on the depth and variety of computer science concepts studied but also how my retention and comprehension of them sets me apart.

### Code Review
A final project consisting of three parts is reviewed and critiqued as I've made significant progress since that class. Especially my proficiency in structuring classes and methods, and adherence to best practices has come a long way to the professional standards I hold myself to today.

### Software Design and Engineering
An application for performing CRUD operations on a list of appointments is re-engineered from Java to Python where the modules can be incorporated into python projects easier
### Algorithms and Data Structure
An application for performing CRUD operations on a list of tasks replaced a linked list to a binary tree and with a balancing algorithm to search larger data sets logarithmically.

### Databases
An application for performing CRUD operations on a list of contacts had a database added and an NLP feature that allows the user to search for contacts in the database by segments of the contacts first or last name.
